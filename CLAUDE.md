This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

A股量化交易策略开发与实盘运行环境。核心标的是**长飞光纤(601869)**，围绕日内做T、选股策略、回测系统三大方向展开。

## Key Rules via `/QMT-export` Skill

When answering QMT API questions, the Skill at `C:\Users\pp313\.claude\skills\QMT-export\SKILL.md` mandates:
- **Never invent** function names, parameters, or features — verify against `references/md/python/python_api.md` first
- **Cite sources** as `[Python API, p.XX]` or `[系统功能, p.XX]`
- **Answer completely in one reply** — don't pause mid-response to ask "should I continue?"
- **Code examples always** — full signatures + parameter docs + runnable code

QMT API reference is in `references/md/` (python, systemfunction, vba subdirectories).

### Strategy Version Evolution (601869 T0)

The QMT live strategies evolved through progressive refinement:

| Version | File | Key Feature |
|---------|------|------------|
| v1 (original) | `长飞光纤_日内做T策略.py` | Backtest + live hybrid, 4 sub-strategies, anti-sell-protection |
| v2 | `QMT_迷你反T_v2_冲高回落_实盘策略.py` | State machine (IDLE→SPIKING→SOLD→DIPPING), 冲高回落确认 |
| v3 | `QMT_迷你反T_v3_高价股_实盘策略.py` | Adapted for 464元 share price (smaller PULLBACK%/BOUNCE%) |
| v4 | `QMT_迷你反T_v4_优化版_实盘策略.py` | `is_last_bar()` historical noise filter, adaptive ATR multiplier |
| **v5 (latest)** | `QMT_迷你反T_v5_动态买回_实盘策略.py` | Buyback trigger based on **actual sell price** (not fixed daily calc) |

### Strategy State Machine (v5)

```
IDLE → SPIKING (price ≥ trigger, tracking peak) → SOLD (pullback confirmed)
                                                      ↓
                                    price ≤ sell_price×(1-ATR%×0.15) → DIPPING
                                                      ↓                    ↓
                                            emergency (price ≥ sell+2%)  bounce ≥ 0.10%
                                                      ↓                    ↓
                                                  买回(紧急)           买回(正常) → DONE
```

### QMT Runtime Context

QMT strategies run inside the QMT client, which provides injected globals:
- `init(ContextInfo)` — called once on strategy load
- `handlebar(ContextInfo)` — called each bar (K-line period)
- `ContextInfo.st` — user-defined state dict (persists across calls)
- `ContextInfo.run_time("funcName", "3nSecond", ...)` — timer for intraday ticks
- `ContextInfo.is_last_bar()` — True for current bar (not historical replay)
- `get_trade_detail_data(account, 'STOCK', 'POSITION'/'ACCOUNT')` — position/cash queries
- `order_shares(code, ±shares, 'FIX', price, ContextInfo, account)` — place orders
- `ContextInfo.get_full_tick([code])` — real-time bid/ask/last price
- `ContextInfo.get_history_data(N, '1d', 'close')` — {code: [values]} dict

File encoding must be `# -*- coding: gbk -*-` for Chinese QMT client.

## Current State (July 2026)

- **Position**: 200 shares 长飞光纤 (601869), cost basis varies per entry
- **Cash**: ~11,638 yuan (insufficient for 1 lot 正T at 464+)
- **Stock price**: ~464 yuan/lot (high ATR: 6-8%, very volatile)
- **Strategy**: 反T only (先卖后买). 正T blocked by cash constraint.
- **Market regime**: Strong bull trend → 反T熔断 activates frequently (correct behavior)
- **Best environment** for this strategy: sideways or bear markets (反T thrives on pullbacks)

## Working Conventions

- All new QMT strategies go in `MyPy-Q/`, named `QMT_*.py`
- When the user asks for strategy adjustments → **create a new file**, increment version number
- Use `_log()` wrapper (defined in each strategy) instead of raw `print()` — it prepends `[HH:MM:SS]`
- All QMT-injected functions (`get_trade_detail_data`, `order_shares`, `passorder`, callbacks) are NOT defined in `.py` files; IDE warnings about them are expected and should be ignored
- Strategy parameters are hardcoded as module-level constants (not JSON/YAML configs)
- Account ID is stored as `ACCOUNT = '8890145315'` in each strategy file

### MCP & Skills awareness (Cloude Code ToolBox)

_Last synced: 2026-08-13T01:03:05.551Z._

- **Full report:** `.claude/cloude-code-toolbox-mcp-skills-awareness.md` in this workspace (auto-overwritten on each scan). Use it as ground truth for configured servers and skill folders.
- **MCP:** For **live tools** in Claude Code, enable the matching server via `/mcp`. Servers are configured in `~/.claude.json` (user) and `.mcp.json` (project).
- **When the user’s task matches a server** (e.g. Confluence work and a **Confluence** / **Atlassian** MCP is listed), **prefer that server id** and plan on tool use—not only file search.
- **Skills:** Folders below contain `SKILL.md`; attach or cite paths in chat when relevant.
